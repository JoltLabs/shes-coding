      She's Coding is a nonprofit organization with the main goal to help close the gender gap in tech. We are a supportive, safe place for anyone identifying as woman or non-binary person in tech, and run a lot of events that are open to women and non-binary folk:

    <ul class="green-links">
      <li>Technical interview preparation sessions.</li>
      <li>Two month-long Code-a-thons.</li>
      <li>Mock interview events with companies. (Let us know if you want to bring it to your company!).</li>
      <li>Fun, talk & networking based meetups - yay!</li>
      <li><%= link_to "Tech Women Rising", "http://techwomenrising.org", target: "_blank"%> conference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally we are working on providing more and better services to the women in tech community via new features on our open-source website, new projects, a more formalized mentorship program, and more.

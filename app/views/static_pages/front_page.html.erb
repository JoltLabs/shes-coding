                <p>We are super thrilled about the launch of the She's Coding Mentorship Program. For a while now we thought about how
                  to best share this network of amazing technical women, minorities and allies that we are building. This mentorship
                  program is our first attempt into a direction of direct enablement and empowerment through matching based on their
                  career goals, their background, their interests and their expertise.</p>
